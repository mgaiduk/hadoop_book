# hadoop_book
This repo is about writing Hadoop code in Kotlin with Gradle as a build tool, and launching it locally as well as on Google's "dataproc".   
It is somewhat inspired by these repos:  
- https://github.com/TeemuKoivisto/kotlin-hello-big-data
- https://github.com/gmariotti/intro-big-data/tree/master/01_hello-big-data
- https://thegmariottiblog.blogspot.com/2017/02/hello-blog-world-learning-big-data-with.html   

When I started writing this, I was a complete newbie in Kotlin, Java and Hadoop, so I will be giving some explanations along the way.
